# DESIGN-625-1
Week 3
interesting Arduino project I found
1. This project use the arduino to control the layout and automate the model trains and the turnouts. A driver board, motor driver and  sensors are connectted to arduino board. Through the sensors, Arduino detect the positions of train and power the driver board to adjust the turnouts and move train.

 2. Automatic Indoor Vegetable Garden
Never forget to water your plants or turn off your grow lights. Never over or under water plants with water pump control and drip system.
